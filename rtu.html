                    <h3>HISTORY OF RTU</h3>
                    <p>Rizal Technological University (RTU) was established on July 11, 1969, upon the approval of the
                        Secretary of Education in response to the utmost request of the Provincial Board of Rizal,
                        headed by Governor Isidro S. Rodriguez, to put up a higher education institution in the Province
                        of Rizal. It was first known as the College of Rizal.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The College of Rizal opened its classes on July 14, 1969, with course offerings in business
                        administration, education, and liberal arts. On March 20, 1975, the College of Rizal in Pasig
                        and Rizal Technical High School in Mandaluyong, both situated in the Province of Rizal, were
                        merged and converted into the Rizal Technological Colleges by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD)
                        No. 674. The decree authorized the expansion of curricular programs and the promotion of
                        research in the development and conservation of natural resources in the Province of Rizal.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This decree broadened the support and strengthened the organization of the college. In 1975,
                        upon the establishment of the Metropolitan Manila Commission, Pasig was transferred to the
                        territorial jurisdiction of the MMC. The province of Rizal could not continue to financially
                        support the colleges. Several alternatives were proposed to save the RTC. One was to transfer
                        the management and administration of the RTC to one of the existing towns in the Province of
                        Rizal or Metropolitan Manila. The worst possible alternative was to phase out the Colleges. The
                        leadership, the faculty, and the studentry of the colleges would not allow this to happen,
                        however, so they worked out the possible nationalization of the RTC.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With the support of then Metropolitan Manila Governor Madam Imelda Marcos, the RTC constituency,
                        the Kabataang Barangay School Chapter of the RTC led by Dr. Jesus Rodrigo F. Torres, and the
                        Collegiate and High School Faculty Clubs at the forefront of the struggle for survival,
                        President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed into law Presidential Decree 1341-A on April 1, 1978,
                        converting the Rizal Technological Colleges into a State College. The decree, however, was
                        received only on October 13, 1978; thus, the RTC has been celebrating its College Week, and
                        later its University Week on the days centered on October 13. After 19 years, the college was
                        converted into the Rizal Technological University on October 11, 1997, by virtue of Republic Act
                        No. 8365.
                        <br>

        <h3>THE PANDAYANG RIZALIA ETHOS</h3>
        <p>Substantiated by RTU's mission to produce graduates honed and cloaked in Dr. Jose Rizal's patriotic ideals
            and values, the “Pandayang Rizalia” came into being.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pandayang Rizalia is a cogent expression construed as a “Forge of Rizalian Ideals” or “Forge of Rizal's
            Teachings” that suggests a place or institution dedicated to nurturing and developing the values and
            principles exemplified by Dr. Jose Rizal such as love of country, intellectual pursuit, social justice, and
            moral integrity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pandayang Rizalia is an educational institution that provides holistic learning environments and learning
            spaces, emboldening the illustriousness of Rizal's patriotism. It is envisioned as a center of learning,
            culture, and character development where individuals are molded and enlaced with Rizal's noble ideals as a
            paragon of wisdom and intellect.
            <br>
            <br>
            RTU also appropriated Pandayang Rizalia as its identifying mantra and moniker to seal its brand with
            reverence to the warrior and hero it is named after. An emblem that highlights academic excellence,
            cultivation of patriotism, critical thinking, and ethical leadership reflecting the spirit of Rizal's life
            and work. An ultimate driver that produces generations honed like metals and beaten into a final shape
            worthy of Rizal's legacy, borne with an inflexible, daring, and zealous character unbending to tyranny.
